## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Nat. I'm a wanderer in the world of blockchain and the internet, making a living as a net-contributor, 3D artist, and content creator. My work revolves around art, memes, and music, often with a Y2K and futuristic style. I also create content related to sim racing, as I have a deep passion for driving. And of course, I love cats!
